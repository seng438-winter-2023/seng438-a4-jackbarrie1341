# Introduction
The objective of this assignment was to familiarize ourselves with Mutation Testing and GUI Testing. Doing mutation testing exposed the group to using a mutation tool and also learning how to interpret the scores, tables and summary produced by the tool. Similarly using Selenium IDE for GUI testing enabled the group to understand and experiment with test automation. It also helped to think of and develop various test cases and suites that we could use to test the interface of the website.

# Analysis of 10 Mutants of the Range class 

# Report all the statistics and the mutation score for each test class



# Analysis drawn on the effectiveness of each of the test classes

# A discussion on the effect of equivalent mutants on mutation score accuracy

# A discussion of what could have been done to improve the mutation score of the test suites

# Why do we need mutation testing? Advantages and disadvantages of mutation testing

# Explain your SELENIUM test case design process
To design our test cases on SELENIUM, as group we first explored the website as normal customers to get a feel of various functionalities and interfaces on the website. After exploring the website, we came together as a group and thought of the functionalities on the website that would be used by most customers on the website which include adding to shopping cart, signing in, registering a new account, adding to whishlist etc, searching. We then designed test cases and suites to test those functionalities using SELENIUM and finally we took a closer look at the functionalities that many customers may not be so eager to use which include using links on the website to redirect to various sections on the website etc and the we created test cases for those scenarios.

# Explain the use of assertions and checkpoints
Assertions are validations which are used to determine the bahaviour of the system. We used assertions to analyze our tests to make sure an expected outcome matched with the actual outcome. It is vital to determining if a test case would pass or not.
Checkpoints are used for verification during testing. They are used to verify and analyze the behaviour of the system which is used to determine whether the test will pass or fail. Assertions are an example of checkpoints.

# how did you test each functionaity with different test data
For each functionality selected, we carried out tests using invalid and valid test data. We used boundary value data, as well as data within the ranges of each test domain with at least two sets of test data for each functionality. In doing this, we were able to determine homogeneity in test outcomes that failed as well as those that passed for a certain functiontionality.
# Discuss advantages and disadvantages of Selenium vs. Sikulix
 - Sikulix has to be installed locally on a device. It requires Java dependencies, being a .jar file to be able to run. Thus, it can be used to test without connection to the internet. However, this can be a disadvantage as access to the tool is not as flexible. Selenium however, is installed on the browser as a plugin. Thus, anyone with an internet connection and a browser can use it which makes it convenient as it can be run from anywhere with a web browser and internet connection. This can pose as a drawback however, if one has no internet connection at the time of use.
 - With Selenium can only be used to test Web-based applications, Wherease Sikulix can test both Web and Desktop Apps making its's flexibility a good advantage. 
 - Selenium slowed down my computer, but was easier to use. While Sikulix was alot faster to use but difficult to figure out.
# How the team work/effort was divided and managed
For the mutation testing part of this assignment and because of the way it was designed, we decided that we weren't going to share tasks for each group member but instead we met first to discuss the assignment as a whole, and then decided to each work on all parts of the assignment; with the final goal of coming together again and merging our outcomes together. However, for the tests with selenium, we decided that each group member would work on two different features each from ikea website, since it was easier to manage and work on individually.

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned
We encountered the most difficulties so far with this assignment. Installing the right version of Selenium and actually making it run was one of our biggest challenges. This was because we encountered various issues while trying to test such as unresponsiveness of the page and slow response time. Some group members had occasionally crashes while trying to run tests. One way we were able to improve the perfomance was by shutting any other running applications as we noticed this resulted in less frequent crashes.

Overall, in this lab, we were able to learn:
- the concept of mutation testing and its advantages and disadvantages
- how to use Selenium in testing GUI for various features of a website
- the pros and cons of Sikulix vs Selenium
- test automation
