# Introduction
The objective of this assignment was to familiarize ourselves with Mutation Testing and GUI Testing. Doing mutation testing exposed the group to using a mutation tool and also learning how to interpret the scores, tables and summary produced by the tool. Similarly using Selenium IDE for GUI testing enabled the group to understand and experiment with test automation. It also helped to think of and develop various test cases and suites that we could use to test the interface of the website.

# Analysis of 10 Mutants of the Range class 

# Report all the statistics and the mutation score for each test class



# Analysis drawn on the effectiveness of each of the test classes

# A discussion on the effect of equivalent mutants on mutation score accuracy

# A discussion of what could have been done to improve the mutation score of the test suites

# Why do we need mutation testing? Advantages and disadvantages of mutation testing

# Explain your SELENUIM test case design process
To design our test cases on SELENIUM, as group we first explored the website as normal customers to get a feel of various functionalities and interfaces on the website. After exploring the website, we came together as a group and thought of the functionalities on the website that would be used by most customers on the website which include adding to shopping cart, signing in, registering a new account, adding to whishlist etc, searching. We then designed test cases and suites to test those functionalities using SELENIUM and finally we took a closer look at the functionalities that many customers may not be so eager to use which include using links on the website to redirect to various sections on the website etc and the we created test cases for those scenarios.

# Explain the use of assertions and checkpoints

# how did you test each functionaity with different test data

# Discuss advantages and disadvantages of Selenium vs. Sikulix

# How the team work/effort was divided and managed
For the mutation testing part of this assignment and because of the way it was designed, we decided that we weren't going to share tasks for each group member but instead we met first to discuss the assignment as a whole, and then decided to each work on all parts of the assignment; with the final goal of coming together again and merging our outcomes together. However, for the tests with selenium, we decided that each group member would work on two different features each from ikea website, since it was easier to manage and work on individually.
